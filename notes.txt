GRVC Tracker.

This repository is based on the ByteTrack code, It employs a trained yolo model for detection and the ByteTracker to perform the tracking algorithm.
Capabilities:

	Can use any darknet model, only needs .cfg and .weights files. 
	Names of the classes can also be provided, though it's optional.
	



Further improvements:
	develop GPU inference compatibility.
	develop framework compatibility.
	develop TensorRT compatibility.
	Implement other trackers, i'm looking at oyu BoT-SORT
	Improve detection model.
	Re-train detection model
	Train Re-ID model -> overkill??
